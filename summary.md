# The Exploration

Let's make a habit of Engineering.

Gratitude to all those who have contributed
to the approach, exercises and evaluations:

## An outside-in view

Engineering is about placing the Customer needs first.

[Try a visit-counter with different stakeholders](https://github.com/Engin-Boot/visit-count-behavior).

## Decomposition of Responsibilities

Decomposition is about making teamwork efficient.

[staged exercise](https://github.com/Engin-Boot/pong-stage)

## Languages and Tools

Build habits and skills for speed and reliability.

These examples start with a failing build, which needs work.
GitHub Actions will run the evaluation workflows.

Yet, it's more than about passing the tests.
Peer reviews need to focus on naming,
ease of understanding, and duplication of information.

## Leverage-and-Develop Case studies

Leverage the past, Develop for the future.

Develop on top of existing software. Always have the next developer in mind.
