## Test Driven Learning

Determine a learning outcome. Write a test to prove it. Repeat.

Along the way:

- Design the test to fail
- Make the failure sharp - one reason for failure
- Leave space for making it better, beyond passing the test

A failing test can be in the form of failing functionality
or a failing metric.

## Create a Channel

Let learners express themselves.
Create a public repository that runs the test when the learner commits.

## Make it Live

Raise an issue on this repository to include your learning.

# We need targeted tests

Here are some areas we need help. Other areas are welcome!

- Functional Programming concepts
- Simplification with data-flows
