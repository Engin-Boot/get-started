# Evaluation Criteria

## Maintainability: 10 points

- Simplicity of code, low cyclomatic complexity
- No duplication
- No warnings & static-analysis findings
- Continuous-integration gating to safeguard these qualities

## Reliability and Tests: 10 points

- Handling of expected errors and unexpected exceptions
- Error-messages understandable to a user
- Unit tests of logic
- Integration tests with off-the-shelf components
- System test with the full integration

## Deployment Efficiency: 10 points

- Clean repository: avoid off-the-shelf components
- Clean deployment: production (Release build),
automated setup,
- Error-messages understandable to service/operations.
- Utilize the full capability of the platform.
E.g., build 64-bit if the runtime environment supports it.

## Teamwork: 10 points

- How have you worked as a team and as individuals?
- Illustrate parts where you worked together and
individual contributions, backed by GitHub commits

## Knowledge capture: 10 points

- Ability to relate to real-world users and situations
- Sequences of actions documented in scripts / automation
- Only non-automatable steps are documented in .md files
- Rationale documented in .md files

## Self-evaluation

- How did the second team receive your knowledge and deliverables?
- What did they find easy? What parts were difficult?
